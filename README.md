# fortran_learning_projects
A personal repo for learning Fortran from https://fortran-lang.org/en/learn/quickstart/

Although we are no longer in 1957 I still love learning new languages, and Fortran has always been on my list. I'm simply going through the Quickstart
tutorial on the Fortran-lang website and this is a handy repo for me to keep track of those projects and work on them from whatever computer I happen
to be working from.
